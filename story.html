      Max is a student who loves to build machines with gears. One day, he discovered that the speed at which the gears rotate is related to mathematical exponents. To control his machines, Max needs to solve problems with exponents, including multiplying gears with the same base and working with multiple exponents stacked on top of each other.
<br>Max challenges himself with different machines where he has to figure out the speed of the gears by using his knowledge of exponents. Can you help Max solve his problems by answering these questions?
